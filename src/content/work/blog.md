## Introduction
As a developer, I always want to make sure that my blog website is up-to-date and using the latest technologies. Recently, I decided to rebuild my website from Next.js to Astro and I wanted to share my experience.

### Why move to astro?
Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications, but I decided to switch to Astro because it promises faster build times and better performance. I wanted my website to be faster and more efficient, so Astro seemed like a good choice.

The first reason I decided to switch to Astro was because of its faster build times. With Next.js, I noticed that my build times were becoming slower as my website grew larger. This was because Next.js generates every page on every build, even if the content hasn’t changed. Astro, on the other hand, only rebuilds pages that have been changed, making the build process much faster.

The second reason I switched to Astro was because it's more performant. Astro uses a lightweight runtime that’s smaller than Next.js, which means that my website loads faster for users. Additionally, Astro only loads the JavaScript required for each page, reducing the overall page size and improving performance.

Lastly, I found that Astro has a simpler syntax. While Next.js is built on top of React, Astro is based on standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This meant that there was less of a learning curve for me, and I was able to adapt quickly. Astro also provides a component system, which made it easy for me to build and reuse components across pages.

## Summary
The process of migrating my website from Next.js to Astro was relatively straightforward. I started by creating a new Astro project and copying over the necessary files from my Next.js project. I then had to update the syntax and make a few minor changes to the code to align with Astro’s component system.
