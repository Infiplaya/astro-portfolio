Coolest Anime is a web application built with Next.js and Prisma that allows users to vote for their favorite anime characters and anime shows. It's a fun way for fans to engage with each other and share their opinions about the coolest characters and shows in the anime world. I was inspired to make it by another app called Roundest, that let's you vote for a rounder pokemon.

The app's user interface is clean and easy to navigate, with separate pages for the coolest anime characters and the coolest anime shows. Users can vote for their favorite characters and shows by clicking on a button next to the name, and they can also see the total number of votes each character or show has received.

One of the standout features of Coolest Anime is its use of Prisma, a database toolkit that provides a type-safe and intuitive way to work with databases. Prisma makes it easy to create and manage the app's database schema and query data from it. With Prisma, I was able to efficiently store and retrieve user votes, making the app fast and reliable.

Another key feature of my application is its use of Next.js, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered applications. Next.js provides a great developer experience by allowing developers to write server-side code in a familiar way, using React components and hooks. Next.js also provides excellent performance and scalability, making it a great choice for building high-traffic web applications.

Overall, Coolest Anime is a great example of how modern web technologies can be used to create fun and engaging applications that connect people around shared interests. If you're an anime fan, be sure to check it out and cast your vote for the coolest anime characters and shows!
