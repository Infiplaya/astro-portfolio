Creating a cryptocurrency tracking app can be a challenging task, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be a rewarding experience. In this blog post, we will take a closer look at how I built a CoinMarketCap-style app using the T3 stack, and the various technologies and techniques that I used to bring it to life.

The T3 stack, which stands for Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, is a powerful set of tools that makes it easy to create modern web applications. I used all of these technologies in my app, and they allowed me to quickly and efficiently build a responsive and user-friendly interface.

The app’s homepage features a list of the 100 most popular cryptocurrencies, which is pulled from an API. Users can click on any of the listed cryptocurrencies to see a page with specific information about that coin. Additionally, users can sign in using Next Auth and add any coins they like to a watchlist, which is powered by Prisma and TRPC.

One of the most challenging aspects of building this app was coming up with new ideas and ways to implement them. I was constantly searching for new features to add and experimenting with different approaches. This was a great learning experience, and it allowed me to develop my skills and knowledge as a developer.

Overall, building this app was a great way to learn and grow as a developer. While it’s not 100% finished yet, I am continuing to work on it and implement new ideas as they come. I hope this blog post has provided some insight into the process of building a cryptocurrency tracking app and the tools and technologies that I used to bring it to life.
