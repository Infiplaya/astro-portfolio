### Note:

I'm currently working on refactoring this app, adding new features, improving design etc.

## Introduction

Cooking is a passion for many of us, and finding new recipes is always exciting. That’s why I decided to create an app that makes it easy for users to discover new and delicious dishes. The concept behind the app is simple: users can either search for a specific recipe or choose to have a random recipe displayed to them.

## Features

The app is easy to use, with a clean and intuitive interface. To get started, simply visit the app’s homepage and click on the “Start” button. From there, you can either create an account or continue as a guest. Once you’re logged in, you’ll be presented with two options: “Search by Dish” or “Random Recipe.”

If you choose the “Search by Dish” option, the app will display a list of recipes that match your query. Simply click on one of the recipes to view the details, which include an image of the dish, its name, a list of ingredients, and the instructions.

The “Random Recipe” option is perfect for those who can’t decide what to cook. With just one click, you’ll be presented with a randomly selected recipe, complete with an image of the dish, its name, ingredients, and instructions.

## Summary

Overall, this app is a great resource for anyone looking to expand their recipe collection. Whether you’re searching for a specific dish or looking for inspiration, this app makes it easy to discover new and delicious recipes. So, why not give it a try and see what delicious meals you can create!
